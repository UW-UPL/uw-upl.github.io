- title: Intro to Functional Programming with Haskell
  date: 2015-10-29 7:00 PM
  location: CS 1240
  description: |
    <p>The UPL Video Lecture Series will be giving a talk on functional programming
    and Haskell this Thursday (10/29) at 7pm in CS 1240. Functional programming, and
    its related concepts, are becoming more prevalent in computation as machines become
    more powerful, concurrent, and complex.</p>

    <p>In this talk, we'll briefly go over the paradigm and then dig in with
    some Haskell, one of the most (in)famous functional programming languages.
    Attendees should be at the intermediate level (i.e. have completed CS 367),
    and should come with laptops with the Haskell platform installed.</p>

- title: Intro to Programming with Ruby
  date: 2015-09-22 7:00 PM
  location: CS 1240
  description: |
    <p>Ruby is the only programming language designed for programmer happiness. Made in
    the 90s, with inspiration from languages such as Perl, Python, Lisp, and
    Smalltalk, Ruby is a great language to learn for beginners and pros alike. It is
    not only useful for small scripting jobs, but it also works well for abstracting
    large systems and powers the ubiquitous Ruby on Rails web framework.</p>

    <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to get up and running with Ruby and on
    your way to programming more happily and productively. The intended audience
    for this talk is beginners, but anyone is welcome to be there.</p>

    <p>We will use a free, online interpreter (<a
    href='https://repl.it/'>repl.it</a>), but you can use Ruby, irb, or your
    Ruby tool of choice, as well.</p>

    <p>Perry Kivolowitz, who recently left UW-Madison for Carthage College, is
    returning to give his famous debugging talk Monday March 28th at 7pm in CS
    1240. Perry is a revered teacher and software crafstman, and has contributed
    much to the areas of graphics and systems. His talk is as entertaining as it
    is informative. We plan on having pizza at the talk! Here's the <a

    <p>The UPL video lecture series (VLS) will be doing a talk targeted at
    students to introduce them to <a href='https://www.python.org/'>Python</a>.
    The talk will assume completion of 302 and will focus on the syntactic
    elements of python and introduce some of the strengths and weaknesses of the
    language. No tools are needed, except for something to take notes with if
    you're interested. All materials will be posted on our public <a
    href='https://github.com/UW-UPL/Talks'>github repository</a>.</p>

- title: 'UPL Answers: What courses should I take?'
  date: 2016-04-11 5:00 PM
  location: CS 1240
  description: |
    <p>The UPL will be walking through the massive collection of computer
    science courses and providing input on what you're likely to learn in a
    given course over the course of the semester. This talk will be targeted at
    freshmen and sophomores who will be jumping into their upper level courses
    soon and aren't quite sure what to take (although all students are
    welcome!).</p>

    <p>If you are wondering if you should post on the computer science facebook
    page about what courses you should take or if a given combination of courses
    in a good idea, consider coming to this event instead prior to registration
    so you can figure things out and get opinions from some rising and
    graduating seniors.</p>
