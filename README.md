# UPL UW Website

Built in Astro and using Tailwind, this is the UPL's basic info website and blog. 

## Adding a new Coordinator

Under `/src/content/coordinators` contains the bios for each Coordinator, create a json file called `firstname-lastname.json` and follow the schema described in `/src/content/config.ts` for coordinators.

To add your picture, title it however you like and save it to  `/src/content/profiles`, reference it just by the file name in the json file.

## Adding a new Blog Post

Create a new .mdx file under `/src/content/blog`, following the schema described in `/src/content/config.ts` for blog posts. It can be saved as `blog-post.mdx` or `blog-post/index.mdx`, both will work.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
