					The UPL is a social club. Stop by any time the room is open! Feel free
					to stop by between classes or as a place to eat your lunch. The UPL
					Coordinators are happy to answer questions, help you with homework,
					help you start a project, and more! Or, don't come in with any goal at
					all! We'd love to meet you.

					The UPL itself does not do any projects. Rather, people within the lab
