## Articles

### Programming advice
- [Why learning to code is so damn hard](https://web.archive.org/web/20150207060837/http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard): One of the best blog posts that details the process of learning programming.
- [The Best of edw519](http://static.v25media.com/edw519_mod.html#chapter_255): A collection of comments by a very experienced software developer, covering a wide range of topics.
- [Development is Inherently Wicked](https://blog.codinghorror.com/development-is-inherently-wicked/): An article talking about software development methodology through the lens of "Wicked Problems".
- [Reflections on a decade of coding](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/reflections-on-a-decade-of-coding/): An interesting series of posts by a guy reflecting on his learnings after a decade of programming professionally.
- [Becoming a Better Programmer by Tightening Feedback Loops](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/tight-feedback-loops): An article detailing an approach to becoming a better developer.

### Projects
- [Challenging projects every programmer should try](https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html): Unsure what to build? Here's a list of projects that will challenge you and help you grow as a developer.
- [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro): A series of backend coding challenges that test your knowledge as a developer, all of which involve recreating commonly used software tools.
- [Vanilla Todo](https://github.com/morris/vanilla-todo): A github repository in which the developer details his approach to creating a Todo app (basic exercise for people learning frontend development and React) using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If you are interested in the engineering underlying frontend development, this will make you drool.
- [JavaScript xv6](https://nullpo-head.github.io/emcc-gaia-simu/xv6.html): An implementation of xv6 (the operating system we hack on in CS 537) in JavaScript, which is crazy. It even has a game of 2048 built in.
- [Writing a NES Emulator in Rust](https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/chapter_1.html): An in-depth series on writing an NES emulator in Rust. Not for the faint of heart.
- [NES Emulator in Lisp](https://github.com/samanthadoran/potential-disco): A github repository of someone's NES emulator written in Common Lisp.

### Useful blogs and posts

- [Venture Capital and the Internet's Impact](https://stratechery.com/): A 2015 blog post that talks about how AWS disrupted traditional venture capital in tech and the emergence of angel investors, Silicon Valley engineers and veterans of the startup scene. I (Rudy) believe this article is slightly outdated, considering the waves of new engineers and the 2022 tech market contractions, but it still provides an interesting look at underlying investment forces with startups.
- [Computational Photography](https://vas3k.com/blog/computational_photography/): A very detailed blog post about the evolution of computational photography and the algorithms behind modern camera system innovations.
- [Socket Programming overview in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html): An overview of sockets programming with Python code snippets. Sockets are a fundamental abstraction for programs sending and receiving data across the internet using the IP protocol.
- [Learning about distributed systems: where to start?](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2020/06/learning-about-distributed-systems.html): A blog post about how to get more in-depth experience with distributed systems. Personally I (Rudy) think this is bad advice for early career developers, and instead I'd recommend building basic full-stack applications that have a frontend, backend, database, authentication, etc for getting more hands-on experience with distributed systems. I personally tried avoiding JavaScript as much as possible, but it is a futile effort.
- [Portable EPUBs](https://willcrichton.net/notes/portable-epubs/): A blog post that provides commentary on various file formats and proposes a new file format standard that takes the best of all worlds (according to the author of course).
- [The engineering behind Figma's vector networks](https://alexharri.com/blog/vector-networks): A blog post detailing the graphics math behind vector networks.
- [Just paying figma 15 dollars a month because nothing else fucking works](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/just-paying-figma-15-dollars): A blog post that talks about the dilemmas of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and what makes Figma a world-class product.
- [The one ring problem: abstraction and our quest for power](https://www.tedinski.com/2018/01/30/the-one-ring-problem-abstraction-and-power.html): A sobering revelation about abstractions being a trade-off for meaningfulness.

### Papers
- [Million.js: A Fast Compiler-Augmented Virtual DOM for the Web](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08409.pdf): A paper detailing a framework/Virtual DOM that speeds up React. Interesting note: the author wrote this in high school.
