## UPL Resources

This page contains selected resources across multiple Computer Science oriented domains, focusing on foundational knowledge, practical applications, and hidden gems.

## Lists
- [Essentials](/resources/essentials): There are many lists filled with largely interchangable guides to language syntax, OOP-style code organization, and using existing libraries.
These lists are sufficient to write software, but they are not sufficient to write *good* software.
This list contains things programmers should be aware of, but are unlikely to encounter on their own.
- [Stuff To Do](/resources/stuff-to-do): Bored? Need project ideas? Looking for something to do? Check out this list!
- [Unix](/resources/unix): Contains a variety of resources on the design, implementation, and historical legacy of Unix-style operating systems.
- [Software Performance](/resources/performance): Gotta go fast.
- [Algorithms](/resources/algorithms): When brute force isn't enough.
- [Databases & Filesystems](/resources/databases-and-filesystems): Storing and working with data.
- [For Fun](/resources/for-fun): Believe it or not, there is fun to be had in computer programming.

### WIP
- [Programming Languages](/resources/programming-languages): Design, implementation, and theory of programming languages.
