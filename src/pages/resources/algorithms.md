# Algorithms

When brute force isn't enough.

- [Logicomix](https://www.logicomix.com/en/): Graphic novel chronicling Bertrand Russell's quest to establish the foundations of mathematics while exploring the personal turmoil of great logicians.
- [MIT Courseware Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63EdVPNLG3ToM6LaEUuStEY): Lecture series that discusses algorithm design and analysis, covering topics like sorting, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and NP-completeness.
- [MIT Coursware Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP6317WaSNfmCvGym2ucw3oGp): Advanced techniques in algorithm design and analysis, including network flows, linear programming, randomized algorithms, and approximation algorithms.
- [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf): Book covering essential topics like dynamic programming, graph algorithms, number theory, and efficient data structures from the perspective of competitive programming.
- [Grokking Algorithms](https://edu.anarcho-copy.org/Algorithm/grokking-algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious.pdf): Beginner-friendly guide to core algorithms including search, sort, recursion, and graph traversal through visual explanations and practical examples.

## Theoretical Algorithms
