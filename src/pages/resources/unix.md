# Unix

Love it or hate it, Unix casts a long shadow over the modern programming world. Many contemporary operating systems like Linux, MacOS, and BSD
are based on the design of Unix and Unix-style shells and command line utilities remain popular.
This list contains a variety of resources on the design, implementation, usage, and historical legacy of Unix-style operating systems. 

- [The UNIX-HATERS Handbook](https://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf): Classic collection of arguments against Unix. Some criticisms are out of date, while many still hold up today. 
- [The Rise of Worse is Better](https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html): Argues the "worse is better" philosophy of Unix and C resulted in more successful software than the "right thing" approach of Lisp.
- [Worse is Worse](https://dreamsongs.com/Files/worse-is-worse.pdf): Rebuttal of "The Rise of Worse is Better" written by the same author under a pseudonym.
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/): The OS (CS537) textbook, written by Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau, two professors at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Written with a heavy Unix-bias. [Shower Curtain](https://www.redbubble.com/i/shower-curtain/OSTEP-Comet-by-ostep/50477786.YH6LW)
- [A fork() in the road](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/04/fork-hotos19.pdf): Argues the Unix fork() system call, used as an example of "getting it right" in OSTEP, is a bad design holding back Operating System development and research

- [Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsB9Cg6yJc4&list=PL0qfF8MrJ-jxMfirAdxDs9zIiBg2Wug0z): Design and implementation of Unix syscalls
- [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) - Way more than you'll ever need to know about Bash.
