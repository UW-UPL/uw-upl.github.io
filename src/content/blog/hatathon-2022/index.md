This past weekend (2/11/22 and 2/12/22) the UPL Hosted its first ever Hatathon, a hat-themed Hackathon! The prompt for the Hatathon was "Help Your Community", and we had around 30 teams attend. The Hatathon was a beginner friendly event, which was intentionally left open ended to allow teams of all skill levels to compete. We're really happy with every project we saw, and were able to help lots of teams with technical questions and helped teams pick up new technologies. The Hatathon was an overnight event, and we had around 20 people stay the full 24 hours (pro-hackers, one might say). Besides programming, contestants did push-ups on the hour (for mental alertness) and yoga at 5am (for relaxation). 

Here's our [Devpost](https://hatathon.devpost.com), where you can find all of the submissions for this year's event!

The first place winner was BadgerLF, a team that made a really cool web-app where Badgers can post items with a corresponding Lost-and-Found style.

The second place winner was FoodIO, a really promising web-app to help coordinate food bank resources with those who need delivery services due to the pandemic.

The third place winner was CrowdCode, a project that aims to crowdsource black box testing for programming projects! We also had a Hackers choice award, where the Hatathon participants chose their favorite project based off of the devpost, which CrowdCode also won.

Our final accolade was a series of Best Hat Awards! For the next Hatathon we'll be giving out even more prizes in this category, so make sure you come with your coolest Hat.
