  "description": "Ruby is the only programming language designed for programmer happiness. Made in the 90s, with inspiration from languages such as Perl, Python, Lisp, and Smalltalk, Ruby is a great language to learn for beginners and pros alike. It is not only useful for small scripting jobs, but it also works well for abstracting large systems and powers the ubiquitous Ruby on Rails web framework. In this tutorial, you will learn how to get up and running with Ruby and on your way to programming more happily and productively. The intended audience for this talk is beginners, but anyone is welcome to be there.",
