MadHacks is Wisconsin's Premier Hackathon! The event will take place on **November 9th-10th, 2024**.

**What's a Hackathon?**\
Hackathons are a 24-hour event where teams of up to four have a friendly competition to create the best projects, products, and more. Food, prizes, mentorship, and events are all available.

**Why should I join a Hackathon?**\
Hackathons give you the environment to make amazing, fulfilling projects in a short amount of time surrounded by driven individuals. Hackathons are also a great way to make projects to put on your resume   (the free food and swag doesn't hurt, either)

**Do I know enough to join a Hackathon?**\
**YES**. Hackathons are made to be beginner friendly. Mentorship, talks, and workshops are available, which all allow for you to grow your abilities quickly. We'll be better equipped to support beginners this time :)
