<p>
Traditionally, anyone is welcome in the UPL room whenever a coord is present,
and coords commit to be present at certain office hours. Since the room is
currently closed for covid, we instead hang out in the discord voice channels
during those hours.

{% if site.data.lab.hours == false %}
  <p>We are not currently holding any official office hours. Check back during the school year. There may be coords in the UPL during the summer; if the door is open, you are welcome to come in.</p>
